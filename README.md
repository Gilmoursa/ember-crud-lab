## Objectives

* Build route handlers. 
* Use Handlebars to iterate over and display of list of Ember data objects. 
* Use handlebars to display a single Ember data object.

## Testing

Just jotting down the steps I took so I don't forget/future reference:

1. Install mocha addon, pretender addon, mirage addon. 
2. set up `app/mirage/scenarios/default.js`.
3. `ember generate acceptance-test routing`.
4. Write tests.
